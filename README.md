# CSC 212 Research Project

## Description
<!-- Description of the project -->
Our project for CSC 212 is a grade/assignment tracker for CSC 212. We will be using Edstem based APIs to interact with Edstem and collect information on Edstem to provide an easy method for tracking assignments in the course.

This project uses a modified version of edapi called [edapiwl](docs/api_doc.md)(wl: with lessons). We Use this API to collect data from the user and we then store the data in various data structures.

For this project we use three data structures:
* Splay Tree
* Binary Heap
* AVL Tree
>For information on each data structure [click here](docs/dsa.md).

## Goals
<!-- Write goals for project -->
- Modify Edstem API to retrieve course and lesson data
- Parse through data generated by Python in C++
- Store data in specified data structures
- Give users the option to view their data in different ways based off of some options/modes.




## Desired Completion Date
