## Project Resources

Below is a table containing the resources used in our project and a brief description of what they were used for.

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [edapi](https://github.com/smartspot2/edapi) | Original API that was modified to allow us to collect data about the user's courses, lessons, etc. |
| [Chatgpt](https://chat.openai.com/) | Chatgpt was used in some areas of this project where additional help/troubleshooting was required. At no point during the developmet was Chatgpt fully relied on to complete labor. |
| [Edstem](https://edstem.org/) | In order for us to understand what type of data to collect we had to relentlessly inspect the json objects that contained the information for courses and lessons. |
| [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) | GeeksforGeeks was a resource we used consistently for understanding the data structures that we decided to work with. |
