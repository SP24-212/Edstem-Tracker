# Data Structures and Algorithms in Use

For the Edstem-Lesson-Tracker project we use the following data structures and algorithms:



```mermaid
mindmap
  root((DSA))
    Tim Sort
    Linked List
    Splay Tree
    Binary Heap 
    Red-Black Tree
```
## Descriptions and Explanations 


### Binary Heap

**Description**
A Binary Heap is a self balancing data structure that acts very similarly to a priority queue with binary search tree qualities

### Splay Tree


---
### Tim Sort


---
### Linked List


---
### Red-Black Tree
