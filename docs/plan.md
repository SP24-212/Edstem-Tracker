# Edstem Tracker Plan

## Coming up With an Objective

<!-- at first we wanted to do ... -->
When we were first brainstorming we initially planned to create a task tracker. We began exploring APIs like [Google's](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer), searching for something that was the most practical for a project with a short window.

Eventually we had the idea of making something to allow students to track their grades more efficiently. We learned that Edstem has API functionality in beta that any user is allowed to use. Once we learned this API existed and eventually found an existing API with solid framework, we started to work on our goal.


## Official Plan

Once there was an idea of how to get started we worked on these steps as follows:

1. [Modify the existing API](api.md)
2. Parsing the Edstem data in C++
3. Store the data in it's correct data structure
4. Enable features for users to see and organize their data
